# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection-using-Random-Forest-Algorithm

## Background of the dataset.

The dataset is taken from the [Kaggle Website](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) website and it has a total of 2,84,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.


## The Methodology code brings out the Solution Approach  that is in full description such as 

1. Data  Understanding, and  exploring.
2. Data cleaning (handling  missing values and Outliers)
3. Exploratory data analysis
4.Prepare data for  modeling
5.Split the data into train and test set
6.Model building
7.Model evaluation
